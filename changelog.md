### [v0.5.0] - 2025-07-02 (03:00 JST)

**AI Contributor:** Cline

**Summary of Changes:**
Implemented the backend logic to process the AI interview summary and generate a player's starting class and stats.

**Detailed Implementation:**
* **Feature:** Created a `processPlayerProfile` function that takes the AI's JSON summary and a `userId` (**Task #7**).
* **Logic:** The function uses keyword matching on the player's skills and interests to assign a `class` (e.g., 'UI/UX Designer', 'AI Developer') and adjust their base `stats` accordingly.
* **Integration:** The `/api/interview` endpoint now calls this new function upon detecting a final JSON summary from the AI.
* **Note:** Full integration is pending the implementation of user sessions to pass the `userId` from the frontend. The logic is in place and has been marked as scaffolding.

**Checklist Items Updated:**
* Task #7: Player Profile & Stat Generation `[IN PROGRESS]` -> `[SCAFFOLDING]`

### [v0.4.0] - 2025-07-02 (02:43 JST)

**AI Contributor:** Cline

**Summary of Changes:**
Implemented the AI-powered player interview feature. This includes the frontend conversational UI and the backend logic to manage a stateful conversation with the OpenRouter API.

**Detailed Implementation:**
* **Feature:** Created a dynamic chat interface for the AI interview, which appears after successful user registration (**Task #5**).
* **Feature:** Built a new `/api/interview` endpoint to handle conversational turns. It maintains conversation history and uses a system prompt to guide the AI (**Task #6**).
* **Refactor:** The `openrouterService` was updated to handle full `messages` arrays, making it suitable for conversational AI features.
* **Integration:** The full registration-to-interview flow is now complete. The frontend correctly transitions between states, and the backend can distinguish between questions and a final JSON summary from the AI.
* **Test Status:** Manually tested the end-to-end registration and interview flow. The conversation works as expected.

**Checklist Items Updated:**
* Task #5: AI Interview Conversational UI `[IN PROGRESS]` -> `[DONE]`
* Task #6: AI Interview Prompt & Logic `[IN PROGRESS]` -> `[DONE]`

### [v0.3.0] - 2025-07-02 (02:37 JST)

**AI Contributor:** Cline

**Summary of Changes:**
Implemented the OpenRouter API integration service to handle all AI model interactions, including secure API key management and error handling.

**Detailed Implementation:**
* **Feature:** Created the `openrouterService.js` module to serve as a centralized point for all AI API calls (**Task #4**).
* **Feature:** Integrated `dotenv` to securely load the OpenRouter API key from an environment file.
* **Feature:** The service includes a reusable function to send prompts to the `deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528` model and parse the response.
* **Test Status:** Created and ran a successful standalone test script (`test_api.js`) to confirm a valid connection and response from the OpenRouter API.

**Checklist Items Updated:**
* Task #4: Setup OpenRouter API Integration `[IN PROGRESS]` -> `[DONE]`

### [v0.2.0] - 2025-07-02 (02:36 JST)

**AI Contributor:** Cline

**Summary of Changes:**
Successfully implemented the full backend registration system after resolving a persistent environmental issue with a ghost process occupying the port.

**Detailed Implementation:**
* **Feature:** Created the `Players` table schema in PostgreSQL (**Task #3**).
* **Feature:** Built a Node.js/Express server with a `POST /api/register` endpoint (**Task #2**).
* **Fix:** Diagnosed and resolved a `EADDRINUSE` error by terminating a conflicting process, which unblocked all development.
* **Integration:** The frontend registration form now successfully communicates with the backend, and new users are correctly persisted in the database.
* **Test Status:** Manually tested the end-to-end registration flow, which is now fully functional.

**Checklist Items Updated:**
* Task #2: Mock Authentication System `[IN PROGRESS]` -> `[DONE]`
* Task #3: `Player` Profile Database Schema `[IN PROGRESS]` -> `[DONE]`

### [v0.1.0] - 2025-07-02 (01:26 JST)

**AI Contributor:** Cline

**Summary of Changes:**
Initialized the entire project structure from an empty directory and completed the first functional task: the frontend UI for player registration.

**Detailed Implementation:**
* **Feature:** Created the complete directory structure, including `public` and `server` folders.
* **Feature:** Populated the core project management files: `rules.md`, `workflow.md`, `changelog.md`, and `checklists.md`.
* **Feature:** Implemented the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the Player Registration UI (**Task #1**).
* **Test Status:** Manually tested the UI in the browser. The form renders correctly, is responsive, and handles submission via JavaScript as expected for this stage.

**Checklist Items Updated:**
* Task #1: Player Registration UI `[IN PROGRESS]` -> `[DONE]`
