### SkillPods Prototype: Detailed Development Checklist

**1. Player Registration UI**
* **Description**: This is the first screen a new player sees. It needs to be simple and intuitive, allowing them to create an account for the prototype.
* **What to do**:
    * Create a single webpage or view.
    * Include three input fields: `username`, `email`, and `password`.
    * Add a "Create Account" button.
* **How to do**:
    * Use standard HTML input elements. The password field should obscure the text (`type="password"`).
    * On button click, the form should gather the data from the fields to be sent to the backend. No complex client-side validation is needed for the prototype.
* **Status**: [DONE]

**2. Mock Authentication System**
* **Description**: A backend process to handle new player registrations. For the prototype, it will create a player profile without needing email verification.
* **What to do**:
    * Create a backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/register`).
    * This endpoint should accept `username`, `email`, and `password` from the registration UI.
    * Create a new player record in the database with the provided details.
* **How to do**:
    * When the endpoint is hit, create a new entry in the `Player` database table.
    * For the prototype, you can store the password as plain text. In a real application, you would hash it.
    * After creating the user, generate a session token to log them in automatically and send it back to the client.
* **Status**: [DONE]

**3. `Player` Profile Database Schema**
* **Description**: Defines the structure for storing all player-related data in the database.
* **What to do**:
    * Design and create a table named `Players`.
    * The table must include columns for `id` (primary key), `username`, `email`, `password`, `stats` (JSON type), `class` (string), `personal_roadmap` (JSON type), and `in_game_currency` (integer).
* **How to do**:
    * Use a database management system (like PostgreSQL which support JSON).
    * The `stats` column will store an object like `{"creativity": 10, "technical": 15, "collaboration": 12}`.
    * The `personal_roadmap` column will store the entire roadmap structure generated by the AI.
* **Status**: [DONE]

**4. Setup OpenRouter API Integration**
* **Description**: This foundational task involves creating a centralized service to communicate with the OpenRouter API. This module will handle all AI model interactions, ensuring API keys are secure and calls are consistent.
* **What to do**:
    * Create a dedicated service module (e.g., `openrouterService.js`) for all API calls.
    * Implement a function to securely load the OpenRouter API key from an environment variable (`.env` file). It must not be hardcoded.
    * Create a reusable function (e.g., `generateApiResponse`) that takes a prompt, specifies the `deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528` model, sends the request to OpenRouter, and returns the response.
    * Implement robust error handling for API issues (e.g., authentication failure, rate limits, invalid requests).
* **How to do**:
    * Use `axios` or `node-fetch` to make `POST` requests to the OpenRouter endpoint: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`.
    * Use a library like `dotenv` to manage environment variables.
    * The body of the `POST` request must include the `model` and `messages` array as specified in the OpenRouter documentation.
    * The function should parse the JSON response and return the AI-generated message content.
* **Status**: [DONE]

**5. AI Interview Conversational UI**
* **Description**: A chat-like interface where the AI will "interview" the new player to understand their skills and goals.
* **What to do**:
    * Create a UI that displays messages from the AI.
    * Include a text input field for the player to type their responses.
    * Messages from both the player and the AI should appear sequentially in a chat log.
* **How to do**:
    * This can be a simple chat bubble interface. When the player submits a message, it should appear on the screen and trigger a call to the AI backend, which will use the OpenRouter service created in Task #4. The AI's response is then displayed as a new message.
* **Status**: [DONE]

**6. AI Interview Prompt & Logic**
* **Description**: The core prompt that instructs the AI on how to conduct the interview and what information to extract.
* **What to do**:
    * Write a detailed system prompt for the `deepseek-r1-0528` model.
    * The prompt should instruct the AI to act as a friendly guide for SkillPods.
    * It should ask a series of questions to determine the player's existing skills, what they want to learn, their interests (e.g., app development, sustainability), and their mission.
    * The final output from the AI must be a structured JSON object.
* **How to do**:
    * **Prompt Engineering**: Start the prompt with the AI's persona. Example: "You are a friendly and insightful guide for SkillPods..."
    * Instruct the AI to ask questions one by one.
    * Crucially, instruct the AI to summarize the entire conversation at the end into a single JSON object like: `{"skills": ["Python", "Figma"], "goals": "I want to become a full-stack developer", "mission": "Build apps that help local communities", "interests": ["Web Development", "AI"]}`.
* **Status**: [DONE]

**7. Player Profile & Stat Generation**
* **Description**: A system that takes the JSON output from the AI interview and translates it into the player's initial stats and class.
* **What to do**:
    * Create a function that receives the JSON from the AI interview.
    * Based on keywords in the `skills` and `interests`, assign a `class` (e.g., "UI/UX Designer", "AI Developer", "Sustainability Ensurer").
    * Generate initial integer values for `stats` (creativity, technical, collaboration).
    * Save this information to the player's record in the database.
* **How to do**:
    * Use simple keyword matching. If `skills` contains "Figma" or "UI", lean towards "UI/UX Designer". If it contains "Python" or "API", lean towards "AI Developer".
    * Assign base stats. For example, a "Designer" might get higher initial `creativity`, while a "Developer" gets higher `technical` stats.
* **Status**: [SCAFFOLDING]

**8. Personal Roadmap Generation**
* **Description**: The AI logic for creating a long-term, personalized learning journey for the player.
* **What to do**:
    * Write a new AI prompt for `deepseek-r1-0528`.
    * This prompt will take the player's full profile (class, stats, goals) as input.
    * It must instruct the AI to generate an open-ended, multi-phase roadmap.
    * The output must be a JSON object with a clear `phase_1` and an `advanced_phases` array, detailing project types and skills to learn.
* **How to do**:
    * **Prompt Engineering**: Instruct the AI to design a logical progression. Phase 1 should contain simpler projects (e.g., "Build a Personal Portfolio Website"). Advanced phases should contain more complex ones ("Develop a Community-Sourced Map App").
    * The JSON structure should be clean, e.g., `{"phase_1": {"projects": [...]}, "advanced_phases": [{"projects": [...]}, ...]}`.
* **Status**: [NOT YET]

**9. Roadmap Display & Feedback UI**
* **Description**: The UI for showing the player their generated roadmap and allowing them to accept or request changes.
* **What to do**:
    * Create a view that clearly visualizes the roadmap, separating Phase 1 from the Advanced Phases.
    * Include an "Accept Roadmap" button.
    * Include a "Request Changes" button next to a text area for feedback.
* **How to do**:
    * When "Accept" is clicked, save the roadmap JSON to the player's profile in the database.
    * When "Request Changes" is submitted, make an API call that sends the original roadmap and the player's feedback text back to the AI for a revised version.
* **Status**: [NOT YET]

**10. AI-Powered Matchmaking Logic**
* **Description**: The system that suggests suitable "pods" (teams) for the player to join based on complementary skills.
* **What to do**:
    * Write an AI prompt that takes the current player's profile and a list of "forming" pods (with their required roles) as input.
    * Instruct the AI to analyze the inputs and recommend the top 3 pods for the player.
    * The AI's output should be a ranked list of Pod IDs.
* **How to do**:
    * The input to the AI should be structured, e.g., `{"player_profile": {...}, "available_pods": [{"pod_id": 1, "needed_roles": ["UI/UX Designer"]}, ...]}`.
    * The AI will match the player's `class` with the `needed_roles`. It can also consider shared `mission` or `interests` for a better match.
* **Status**: [NOT YET]

**11. Pod Suggestion & Joining UI**
* **Description**: The interface where the player sees their suggested pods and can choose to join one.
* **What to do**:
    * Create a UI to display the suggested pods as cards.
    * Each card should show the pod's project goal, the roles that are already filled (with usernames), and the roles that are still needed.
    * Each card must have a "Join Pod" button.
* **How to do**:
    * Fetch the data for the suggested pods from the backend.
    * Clicking "Join Pod" triggers a backend call to add the player's ID to that pod's `members` list and update the pod's status.
* **Status**: [NOT YET]

**12. Team Roadmap Generation**
* **Description**: Once a pod is full, this system generates a unified project plan for the team.
* **What to do**:
    * Create a background process that detects when a pod's required roles are filled.
    * When a pod is full, trigger a new AI prompt.
    * This prompt will take the profiles of all pod members as input.
    * The AI must generate a single "Team Roadmap" with a 2-4 week project plan, specific milestones, and initial tasks for the team. The plan must contain at least two distinct projects/milestones.
* **How to do**:
    * The AI should be instructed to synthesize the skills of all members to create a feasible and relevant project. For example, if the team has a designer and a developer, a milestone could be "Week 1: Finalize UI/UX in Figma; Week 2-3: Develop the front-end".
    * The output should be a JSON object representing the team's plan.
* **Status**: [NOT YET]

**13. Pod Workspace & AI Mentor UI**
* **Description**: The central hub for the team to collaborate, chat, and get help from their AI mentor.
* **What to do**:
    * Create a dedicated "Workspace" page for each active pod.
    * This page needs a group chat interface.
    * It should also display the "Team Roadmap".
    * The AI Mentor should be present in the chat, identifiable as an AI.
* **How to do**:
    * The chat can be a standard real-time chat implementation.
    * When a player sends a message starting with `@AIMentor`, the message content is sent to the AI Mentor's prompt for a response, which is then posted back into the chat.
* **Status**: [NOT YET]

**14. AI Mentor Master Prompt**
* **Description**: The core prompt that gives the AI Mentor its personality and capabilities.
* **What to do**:
    * Write a detailed system prompt for the AI Mentor.
    * The prompt should give the AI a helpful, guiding persona.
    * It must be given the Team Roadmap and all player profiles as context.
    * It should be capable of answering questions, suggesting resources, helping to break down tasks, and offering encouragement.
* **How to do**:
    * **Prompt Engineering**: "You are an AI Mentor for a team of learners. Your goal is to help them succeed in their project. You are supportive, knowledgeable, and proactive. Here is the team's project plan and their profiles: [insert data]."
* **Status**: [NOT YET]

**15. Project Submission & Peer Review System**
* **Description**: A two-part system for wrapping up a project. Players submit their work and provide confidential feedback on their teammates.
* **What to do**:
    * Create a "Submit Project" form with a field for a URL (to GitHub, Figma, etc.) and a text area for an "Individual Contribution Report".
    * After submission, present the player with a "Peer Review" form for each teammate.
    * The review form should have sliders or radio buttons for metrics like **Collaboration**, **Communication**, and **Quality of Contribution** (scale of 1-10).
* **How to do**:
    * Store all submissions and reviews in a new database table, linking them to the project and the players involved. Ensure peer reviews are stored in a way that they can be accessed for assessment but are not visible to other players.
* **Status**: [NOT YET]

**16. AI Project Assessment Engine**
* **Description**: The final, most complex AI prompt. It synthesizes all project data to provide a fair assessment of each player's performance.
* **What to do**:
    * Write a master AI prompt for assessment.
    * The prompt will take all related data as input: the final project URL, all individual summaries, all peer reviews, and a summary log from the AI Mentor's chat.
    * Instruct the AI to cross-reference the data and provide a detailed, fair assessment.
    * The final output must be a single JSON object containing the overall project score, individual analysis, updated stats for each player (e.g., `{"stat_updates": [{"player_id": 1, "technical": "+10", "collaboration": "+15"}]}`), and the currency awarded to each player.
* **How to do**:
    * **Prompt Engineering**: "You are a fair and objective AI Assessor. Your task is to evaluate the completed project based on the following data bundle... Look for correlations between self-reported contributions, peer feedback, and tangible evidence in the project link. Award stat points and currency based on both individual effort and team success."
* **Status**: [NOT YET]

**17. Post-Project UI & Logic**
* **Description**: The system to process the AI assessment, update player profiles, and guide them to their next step.
* **What to do**:
    * Create a function to parse the JSON output from the AI Assessment Engine.
    * Update each player's `stats` and `in_game_currency` in the database according to the assessment results.
    * Create a "Project Complete" summary UI to show players their new stats and rewards.
    * Automatically trigger the matchmaking logic (Task 10) to suggest new pods for the players' next project.
    * Update the player's personal roadmap UI to mark the completed project with a checkmark.
* **How to do**:
    * This is primarily a data-handling task. Carefully parse the assessment JSON and apply the updates to the correct player records. The flow should be automated: once assessment is done, the player is immediately shown their results and prompted to find a new team.
* **Status**: [NOT YET]
